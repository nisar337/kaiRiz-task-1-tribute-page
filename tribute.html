          Abdul Qadeer Khan (born April 1, 1936, Bhopal, India—died October 10,
          2021, Islamabad, Pakistan) was a Pakistani engineer, a key figure in
          Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program who was also involved for decades
          in a black market of nuclear technology and know-how whereby
          uranium-enrichment centrifuges, nuclear warhead designs, missiles, and
          expertise were sold or traded to Iran, North Korea, Libya, and
          possibly other countries.
        </li>
        <li>
          In 1947, during Khan’s childhood, India achieved independence from
          Britain, and Muslim areas in the east and west were partitioned to
          form the state of Pakistan. Khan immigrated to West Pakistan in 1952,
          and in 1960 he graduated from the University of Karachi with a degree
          in metallurgy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over the next decade he pursued graduate studies abroad, first in West
          Berlin and then in Delft, Netherlands, where in 1967 he received a
          master’s degree in metallurgy. In 1972 he earned a doctorate in
          metallurgical engineering from the Catholic University of Leuven in
          Belgium.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, in 1964 he married Hendrina Reterink, a British national
          who had been born to Dutch expatriate parents in South Africa and
          raised in what was then Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) before moving
          to the Netherlands.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the spring of 1972 Khan was hired by Physical Dynamics Research
          Laboratory, a subcontractor of the Dutch partner of URENCO. URENCO, a
          consortium of British, German, and Dutch companies, was established in
          1971 to research and develop uranium enrichment through the use of
          ultracentrifuges, which are centrifuges that operate at extremely high
          speeds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Khan was granted a low-level security clearance, but, through lax
          oversight, he gained access to a full range of information on
          ultracentrifuge technology and visited the Dutch plant at Almelo many
          times. One of his jobs was to translate German documents on advanced
          centrifuges into Dutch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Khan was heavily influenced by events back home, notably Pakistan’s
          humiliating defeat in a brief war with India in 1971, the subsequent
          loss of East Pakistan through the creation of a new independent
          country, Bangladesh, and India’s test of a nuclear explosive device in
          May 1974. On September 17, 1974, Khan wrote to Pakistan’s prime
          minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, offering his assistance in preparing an
          atomic bomb.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the letter he offered the opinion that the uranium route to the
          bomb, using centrifuges for enrichment, was better than the plutonium
          path (already under way in Pakistan), which relied on nuclear reactors
          and reprocessing.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the early 1980s Pakistan acquired from China the blueprints of a
          nuclear weapon that used a uranium implosion design that the Chinese
          had successfully tested in 1966. It is generally believed that the
          Chinese tested a derivative design for the Pakistanis on May 26, 1990.
          Khan, having satisfied Pakistan’s needs for its own uranium weapon,
          began in the mid-1980s to create front companies in Dubayy, Malaysia,
          and elsewhere, and through these entities he covertly sold or traded
          centrifuges, components, designs, and expertise in an extensive
          black-market network. The customers included Iran, which went on to
          build a uranium-enrichment complex based on the Pakistani model. Khan
          visited North Korea at least 13 times and is suspected of having
          transferred enrichment technology to that country. (His laboratory
          also developed Pakistan’s Ghauri ballistic missile with help from the
          North Koreans.) Libya, supplied by Khan, embarked upon a nuclear
          weapons program until it was interrupted by the United States in 2003.
